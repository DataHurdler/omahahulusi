# General Information

This folder contains all sheet music, in both staff notation and jianpu notation, for the Omaha Hulusi Ensemble. They are organized in sub-folders, with the numbers in the front of folder names indicate the order they were prepared.

Sheet music were prepared using ABC Notation. I use a mix of [EasyABC](https://easyabc.sourceforge.net/) and [Michael Eskin's ABC Transcription Tool](https://michaeleskin.com/abctools/abctools.html) to edit these ABC files. To compile in jianpu, I use [ABC edit with abc2svg](http://moinejf.free.fr/js/edit-1.xhtml).
